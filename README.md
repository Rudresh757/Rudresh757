## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Science student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, currently in my final year. My journey into tech began back in high school, sparked by a love for robotics and the logic behind machines — and since then, there's been no looking back.

Over the years, I've developed a solid foundation in **C++**, **Python**, and **SQL**, with C++ becoming my go-to language for problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. I thrive on challenges, both in solo projects and collaborative environments, and I’m always exploring new ways to bring ideas to life through code.

Currently, I'm working as a **Software Developer Intern at IJ Bridge**, a Japan-based client services company, where I'm honing my skills in real-world software development and learning how tech can bridge global communities.
